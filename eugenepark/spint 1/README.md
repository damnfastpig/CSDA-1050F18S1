### Sprint1

In Sprint1, I have focused on exploring my HR dataset, in effort to discover any significant features that might influence employee retention, prior to building any predictive model. Sample visualizations are demonstrated. Please refer to CSDA1050_Sprint1_Eugene_Park.html in this repo. 

###Sample Visualization
Here is a list of sample visualizations explored throughout Sprint1. The key findings are that there can be correlation between some features from the dataset and employee retention. 

Trend in Employees' job level on retention has been explored.

###Conclusion from Sprint1
I feel that I have enough data to create an analysis that fulfills the initial objective. Meanwhile the focus is to utilize both data visualization and predictive model in this research, I would like to also focus on developing a way to deliver this material very clearly and efficiently to stakeholder who are new to data science field.  


##Next Steps
1. I believe there is some trend that can be discovered intuitively by observing data visualization. I'd like to invest some more time in developing something that can deliver information more efficiently. 
2. In addition to above, I will explore a several machine learning algorithms to test if they can provide predictive power. 
3. I also have company's financial data which demonstrates company's financial performance year-over-year. It will be interesting to see how its financial history reenacts with HR history.
