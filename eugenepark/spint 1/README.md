### Sprint1

In Sprint1, I have focused on exploring my HR data, in effort to discover any significant features that might influence employee retention. Sample vidualizations are demonstrated. To fully utilize its interactive funtionality, please open CSDA1050_Sprint1_Eugene_Park.html. 


##Next Step
1. I believe there is some trend that can be discovered intuitively by observing data visualization. I'd like to invest some more time in developing something that can deliver information more efficiently. 
2. In addition to above, I will explore a several machine learning algorithms to test if they can provide predictive power. 
3. I also have company's financial data which demonstrates company's financial performance year-over-year. It will be interesting to see how its financial history reenacts with HR history.
