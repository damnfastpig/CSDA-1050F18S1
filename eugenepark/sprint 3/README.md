Utilizing Machine Learning in Employee Retention in an Advertising Agency

Sprint 3 concludes all analysis performed for the topic during last 8 weeks. Below is a break down of what was accomplished in each phase. 

### Sprint1

In Sprint1, I have focused on exploring my HR dataset, in effort to discover any significant features that might influence employee retention, prior to building any predictive model. For detailed report, please refer to CSDA1050_Sprint1_Eugene_Park.pdf in Sprint 1 folder.

### Sprint2

Continuing from Sprint1, as meaningful variables are discovered, those variables are used to build a predictive model. In the beginning, this exercise focuses on building a classification model that can predict employee's Active, Quit and Terminated status. Later on, a regression model gets developed to discover correlation between hiring cost and revenue. For detailed report, please refer to CSDA1050_Sprint2_Eugene_Park.pdf in Sprint 2 folder.

### Sprint 3

Sprint 3 incorporates all discoveries from Sprint 1 and Sprint 2. Along with data analysis through data visualization and machine learning models, how the findings apply to real business is narrated for stakeholder's understanding. CSDA1050 Sprint3 Final Report Eugene Park.pdf file demonstrates the essence of all discoveries.
